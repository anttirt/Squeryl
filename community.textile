Come discuss with us on how to improve Squeryl, or get help by <u><a target='none' href='http://groups.google.com/group/squeryl'>joining the group</a></u>

h2. Submitting Issues, bugs and feature requests

The best place for submiting ideas is on the "discussion group":http://groups.google.com/group/squeryl

For issues and bugs we will start by using "GitHub's issue tracker":http://github.com/max-l/Squeryl/issues

h2. Help us make Squeryl a game changing technology

There are no shortage of interesting problems requiring elegant solutions. Squeryl's DNA, could certainly be enhanced by capable and talented minds.

h2. Building from Sources

Info on building is found "here":http://github.com/max-l/Squeryl/blob/master/readme.txt

At the moment the test mechanism is to call test code from the org.squeryl.tests.allTestsOnH2
this runs the tests within "H2":http://www.h2database.com/ as the name implies. 
(Agreed... Squeryl should migrate to a real test framework, it will eventually happen !!!)

Testing on H2 is really great because it doesn't require you to setup a database, if you build with 
"SBT":http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool you will have an "H2":http://www.h2database.com/ database ready to run the tests, and if 
the test succeds on H2, making it work on other DBs should be straight forward.
